Terms
-----
clock =            master clock (21.477272 MHz)
dot   = 4 clocks  = PPU pixel time
cycle = 12 clocks = CPU instruction cycle

Times relative to earliest in frame that $2002 reads VBL flag as set ($80), where that time is 0 dots + 0 clocks.


Scope
-----
The scope settings are in the photos. Note that the voltage range is 2V/div since 10x probes are being used. Most pictures use 0.1uS/div (i.e. 100ns/div).

Many of the B channel traces have the clock slightly visible.

enable nmi around vbl end
-------------------------
Enables NMI around when VBL is ending

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that writes $80 to $2000
CHB: /VBL

6818 dots + 3 clocks is the latest in the frame that NMI can be enabled and still occur. 6819+0 doesn't cause NMI, even though VBL spikes low for a moment.


read 2002 around vbl end
------------------------
Reads $2002 around when VBL is ending

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that reads $2002
CHB: /VBL

Two versions of CHB are superimposed: one with the $2002 read, and one without it, so that the time of normal clearing of /VBL can be seen for reference.

6819 dots + 3 clocks is the latest in the frame that $2002 can be read back as $80. 
5820 dots + 0 clocks reads back as $00.


read 2002 around vbl begin
--------------------------
Reads $2002 around time VBL begins.

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that reads $2002
CHB: /VBL

Two versions of CHB are superimposed: one with the $2002 read, and one without it, so that the time of normal assertion time /VBL can be seen for reference.

As expected, the earliest read that finds the VBL flag set is at 0 dots + 0 clocks, since this is the definition of our relative times.


nmi after 2002 read before vbl
------------------------------
Reads $2002 somewhat before VBL begins, and notes whether this suppresses NMI.

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that reads $2002
CHB: /VBL

Two versions of CHB are superimposed: one with the $2002 read, and one without it, so that the time of normal assertion time /VBL can be seen for reference.

The latest $2002 can be read without suppressing assertion of /VBL (and thus the NMI) is -2 dots + 1 clock (that is, -7 clocks). It's interesting that for two clock offsets, the $2002 read very slightly delays when /VBL goes low but doesn't suppress it.


nmi detection time
------------------
Reads $2002 slightly after VBL begins, to find latest time in previous instruction cycle that it can trigger NMI.

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that reads $2002
CHB: /VBL


2006 write to PPU A13 output
----------------------------
Writes $2006 at the four CPU-PPU alignments.

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that writes $2006
CHB: PPU A13

This shows how the PPU quantizes $2006 address changes to a dot. All four result in PPU A13 changing at the same time.


PPU address change vs vbl
-------------------------
Writes to $2006 to change PPU address at various times relative to VBL begin.

CHA: PPU A13
CHB: /VBL

This shows how the PPU quantizes $2006 address changes to a dot, and how the change time is almost synchronized with the /VBL time (about 38 ns earlier than /VBL). This might be useful for other measurements.


Read latch time
---------------
Has CPU D7 change at various times in read cycle.

CHA: CPU A8, low for cycle that reads
CHB: CPU D7 input

CPU apparently latches about 460ns after A8 goes low.
